# birthday_card
a website acting like a birthday card


This is a personal project for a little present for someone's birthday, it has HTML, CSS and Javascript all crammed togheter so it's not really good practice but it does it's job.

For hosting i reccomend using Cloudflare Pages since Github pages must be public to work and the photos that you public could be seen by anyone, that is still true for Cloudflare 
pages since it is a website, but a really niche URL is harder to find than a public github repository.

The main things to change are the Name and the Date inside the HTML, then you can just modify the text that appears after the balloons are popped. 
For photos and video to appear they have to be in folders at the same level of index.html named videos and images.
